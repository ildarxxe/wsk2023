# Handout Module E - Task 2


## Starting the frontend server

Because PWAs do not work with file URLs, a simple HTTP server is provided to you.

Run the following commands **inside this folder** to start the frontend server:
```bash
npm set registry 
npm install
npm start
```

Your web app is then available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Provided template

A simple template is already provided to you within the `src` folder.
It provides a starting point and you can extend it to implement the requested functionality.
